## Puzzle

A definition for an ellipse is: Given a circle $c$ with centre $M$ and radius $r$ and a point $G$ such that $d(G,M) \\lt r$, the locus of the points that are equidistant from $c$ and $G$ form an ellipse. The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below. Given are the points $M(-2000,1500)$ and $G(8000,1500)$. Given is also the circle $c$ with centre $M$ and radius $15000$. The locus of the points that are equidistant from $G$ and $c$ form an ellipse $e$. From a point $P$ outside $e$ the two tangents $t\_1$ and $t\_2$ to the ellipse are drawn. Let the points where $t\_1$ and $t\_2$ touch the ellipse be $R$ and $S$. For how many lattice points $P$ is angle $RPS$ greater than $45$ degrees?
